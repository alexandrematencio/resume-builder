## Core Offering

### What Makes CareerTech Unique

CareerTech is **not** a job board. It is **not** an application tracker. It is an **AI-powered job evaluation and application preparation platform** that answers one question before any other:

> **"Is this job worth my time?"**

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **1. AI Profile-to-Job Matching** | Import any job description. AI scores it against your profile — skills match, salary fit, location, remote policy, perks. Hard blockers are surfaced. A match score (0-100) tells you at a glance if it's worth pursuing. | ✅ Live |
| **2. AI Document Generation** | Your profile + job requirements = tailored CV and cover letter per application. AI restructures your experience to highlight what matters most for each role. Multiple styles (french formal, american creative, etc.). | ✅ Live |
| **3. Complete Application Pipeline** | From job evaluation → application creation → interview tracking → offer/rejection. One tool for the entire lifecycle. | ✅ Live |

### What We Are NOT

- Not a job board (we don't source jobs — the user imports them)
- Not volume-driven (quality of match over quantity of applications)
- Not a black box (every score is transparent, every suggestion is editable)
- Not addictive (no gamification, no FOMO, no streak counters)

### Differentiation vs Competitors

## Core Values & Priorities

### UX Priorities (from DESIGN-SYSTEM.md)

| Priority | Principle | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Reliability & Trust** | First 5 seconds must convey professionalism |
| 2 | **Anti-Fatigue** | Minimize decision fatigue and post-action regret |
| 3 | **Empowerment** | User always feels in control |
| 4 | **Inclusivity** | Accessible design, even at aesthetic cost |
| 5 | **Anti-Addiction** | Never optimize for "time spent" or "volume" |

### Brand Personality (from BRAND-IDENTITY.md)

1. **Moderne** – Contemporary, not trendy
2. **Professionnel** – Serious without being cold
3. **Minimaliste** – Every element earns its place
4. **Calme** – Reduces anxiety, never creates it
5. **Raffiné** – Thoughtful details, premium feel
6. **Premium** – Worth paying for
7. **Bienveillant** – User's advocate, not a sales tool

### Forbidden Patterns

- Gamification of job applications
- Infinite scroll on job listings
- Celebratory micro-interactions
- "You've applied to X jobs!" metrics
- Dark patterns to increase engagement
- Excessive AI automation without user control

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria

#### AC-01: Preference-Based Blocking

```gherkin
GIVEN a user has set minSalary = €50,000/year
WHEN a job offers max €45,000/year
THEN the job is marked as "blocked"
AND the block reason shows "Salary below minimum"
AND the job is still visible (not hidden)
```

#### AC-02: Multi-Rate Salary Handling

```gherkin
GIVEN a user has set:
  - minSalary = €50,000/year (for CDI)
  - minHourlyRate = €50/hour (for freelance)
  - minDailyRate = €400/day (for TJM)
WHEN a job specifies "35€/hour"
THEN the system compares against minHourlyRate (not minSalary)
AND marks as blocked if below €50/hour
```

#### AC-03: URL Import Auto-Fetch

```gherkin
GIVEN a user enters a job posting URL
WHEN they click "Fetch & Parse"
THEN the system fetches the page content
AND extracts the job description
AND parses it into structured fields
AND shows preview for review
```

#### AC-04: Language Proficiency Matching

```gherkin
GIVEN a user has "French: Native, English: Bilingual" in profile
WHEN analyzing a job requiring "French language proficiency"
THEN the AI recognizes the match
AND does NOT flag French as a skill gap
```

#### AC-05: Score Transparency

```gherkin
GIVEN a job has been analyzed
WHEN viewing job details
THEN the user sees:
  - Overall score (0-100)
  - Skills match percentage
  - Perks match count
  - Block status with reasons (if any)
  - Matched skills list
  - Missing skills list
```

| Waiting for Parse | Mild Anxiety | 5 | Calm loading state, no countdown |
| Review Parsed Data | Control | 8 | Editable fields, clear feedback |
| Waiting for Analysis | Anticipation | 6 | Purposeful animation, no hype |

- [x] Is there a "slow mode" option? → No (consider for v2)
- [x] Are negative results presented with dignity? → Yes

### 2.10 Voice & Tone Guidelines

#### Micro-Copy Principles

| Context | Do | Don't |
|---------|----|----|
| Success states | "Job saved." | "Awesome! Job saved! 🎉" |
| Error states | "Unable to fetch URL. Try pasting the description." | "Oops! Something went wrong!" |
| Loading states | "Analyzing..." | "Hold tight! Magic happening!" |
| Empty states | "No jobs yet. Import one to get started." | "Looks empty here! 😢" |
| Blocked jobs | "Below your minimum salary." | "This job doesn't pay enough!" |
| Match scores | "72% match with your profile" | "Great match! You should apply!" |

#### Tone Matrix

| Situation | Tone | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Positive result | Factual, understated | "Strong alignment with your skills." |
| Negative result | Respectful, actionable | "Missing: React, TypeScript. Consider highlighting related experience." |
| User error | Helpful, no blame | "Please enter a valid URL." |
| System error | Honest, solution-focused | "Analysis unavailable. Your data is saved." |
| Onboarding | Welcoming, minimal | "Set your preferences to get started." |

#### Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Amazing, Awesome, Great | Good, Strong, Clear | Over-enthusiasm feels cheap |
| Oops, Uh-oh | (nothing, just state fact) | Infantilizing |
| Sorry | (rephrase without apology) | Over-apologizing weakens trust |
| Just, Simply | (remove) | Implies task is trivial |
| AI-powered, Smart | (describe what it does) | Buzzword fatigue |

### Navigation & Information Architecture
- Section "Jobs" renamed to **"Matching"** with `Target` icon (was `Briefcase`)
- Empty state onboarding copy updated: "Evaluate jobs before you apply."
- Stat card: "Total Jobs" → "Imported"
- Account back button: uses `router.back()` (context-aware) instead of hardcoded `/`

### Landing Page Overhaul
- Hero: "Know which jobs fit you **before you apply.**"
- Removed all "coming soon" / "waitlist" language (Job Intelligence is live)
- Features reordered: matching → filtering → CV → cover letters → role profiles → pipeline
- Dark section: "Coming Soon" → "Core Feature" highlight
- How It Works: 3 steps → 4 steps (includes matching flow)
- CTA: "Stop guessing. Start matching."
- Removed fake social proof

### Interview Filter Fix
- Applications with status `offer`, `rejected`, or `closed` are now excluded from the Interview filter tab and stat count (previously they lingered if `interviewScheduled` was set)

### Job Analysis Improvements
- Cross-language skill matching (French ↔ English equivalents)
- Work experience achievements used as evidence of skills
- AI insights include: strengths, skill gaps, strategic advice, culture fit, growth potential, red flags
